# Cardable
## Kanban Board Javascript Single Page Application (Flatiron School Phase 4 project)

Cardable is a basic Kanban board (think Trello) with columns for Uncategorized, To-Do, In-Progress, and Completed tasks (cards). Users can create new cards in any column and move existing cards to new columns based on the status of a task. Cards can also be deleted when they are no longer needed.

### Installation

To install Cardable, first clone this repo. Inside the `/cardable/backend` directory, run `bundle install` and `rails db:migrate`. You can also run `rails db:seed` if you would like some sample data to work with.

Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser to run the application.
